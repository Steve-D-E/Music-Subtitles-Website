        <p><strong>Captions and subtitles</strong> aren't always the first things a video producer or a vlogger thinks
            about. However, here are a few good reasons to start thinking about it right now.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Deaf and hard of hearing followers</strong>. If your video has dialogue, deaf and hard of
                hearing people will not understand them unless you caption them. It may be extra work but it's worth it,
                considering you want to maximize your reach.</li>
            <li><strong>People who watch videos on mobile, in public</strong>. Some people watch videos when they are in
                public, at the office, or at night. For whatever reason, they choose not to use the sound or they cannot
                use it without disturbing those around them. Closed captions and subtitles will allow them to receive
                the message and understand it.</li>
            <li><strong>Muted autoplay</strong>. Some social media platforms allow you to adjust the settings and
                receive your auto-played videos with muted sound. Muted play may deliver your message when it is set on
                auto but only if it is captioned or subtitled.</li>
            <li><strong>People who are not native in your language</strong> or who have trouble understanding the spoken
                word. Besides deaf and hard of hearing people who, for one reason or another, cannot listen to an audio
                stream, there will always be people who will find it hard to understand an audio stream without
                subtitles.</li>
            <li><strong>Engagement and ROI</strong> are two of the main metrics you have to measure when you assess a
                visual marketing campaign. They all depend on the audience spending more than a few seconds on your
                content and when it comes to video, subtitles may help you in this area.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>The above was taken from: <a
                    href="https://zubtitle.com/blog/why-adding-captions-to-your-social-videos-is-an-absolute-must-in-2019">Zubtitle</a>.
                However, the author has amended 'hearing impaired' in the original article to 'Deaf and hard of
                hearing'</em></p>
