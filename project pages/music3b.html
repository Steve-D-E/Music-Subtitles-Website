        <p>Prince Buster (Cecil Bustamente Campbell, 24 May 1938 - 8 September 2016) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter
            and producer. He is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of ska and rocksteady
            music. The records he released in the 1960s influenced and shaped the course of Jamaican contemporary music
            and created a legacy of work that later reggae and ska artists would draw upon.</p>
        <p>Born Cecil Bustamente Campbell on Orange Street in Kingston, Jamaica, his middle name was given to him by his
            family in honour of the Labour activist and first post-Independence Prime Minister William Alexander Clarke
            Bustamante, in the early 1940s Campbell was sent to live with his grandmother in rural Jamaica where his
            family's commitment to the Christian faith gave him his earliest musical experiences in the form of church
            singing as well as private family prayer and hymn meetings. Returning to live at Orange Street while still a
            young boy; Campbell attended the Central Branch School and St. Anne's School. While at school Campbell
            performed three or four times a week at the Glass Bucket Club as part of Frankie Lymon's Sing and Dance
            Troupe; rock 'n' roll themed shows were popular during the 1950s with the Glass Bucket Club establishing a
            reputation as the premier music venue and social club for Jamaican teenagers at that time.</p>
