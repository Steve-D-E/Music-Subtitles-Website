        <h4><strong>About the song, Going Underground</strong></h4>

        <p>From the jaunty hook to the barrelling bass patterns that cement the track, everything heard on ‘Going
            Underground’ screams classic. And although it was written by guitarist Paul Weller, the tune holds some of
            Bruce Foxton’s most inventive bass playing, and Rick Buckler curated some of the most exciting percussion
            effects in the band’s trajectory.</p>
        <p>The single was The Jam’s first UK number one, earning them a success that was largely denied to The Clash
            during the 1980s. The band were always that little bit too English to break into the American charts, but
            the British buying public more than compensated, hailing them as the eminent voices of their generation.
            ‘Going Underground’ proved a densely produced number that found the band calling attention to the failings
            of the Conservative government, a party the band had previously championed in a fanzine in 1977.</p>
        <p>But by the turn of the decade, with the rise of Thatcherism, the band were struggling to salute a government
            that failed to acknowledge their personal philosophies. Weller was slowly becoming a voice for the working
            classes and seemed happy to leave a fable to the teenagers frequenting the record stores for his work. But
            he and the band were savvy enough to infuse the aphorisms with bounce, buoyancy and infectious melodies, to
            ensure that the work hit as many listeners as possible</p>
