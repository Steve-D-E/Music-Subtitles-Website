        <h3><strong>YouTube</strong></h3>
        <p>On YouTube, you have the opportunity to let their AI speech recognition software auto-caption your videos.
            The <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en">official tutorial</a> explains how to
            do this in just a few easy steps.</p>
        <p>You can add your own .srt subtitles as well. All you need to do is to go to your “Video Manager”. Select the
            drop-down menu available next to the video file you want to play with subtitles and choose the
            “Subtitles/CC” option:</p>
        <p>Next, you will have three options available:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload a file</li>
            <li>Transcribe and auto-sync</li>
            <li>Create new subtitles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The option we are interested in here is the first one: Upload a new file: Choose your file (a locally saved
            .srt subtitle) and upload it on YouTube.</p>
        <p>The problem with using YouTube's native auto-captioning is that it can be very buggy and often doesn't
            accurately transcribe your video.</p>
        <p><a href="https://zubtitle.com/">Zubtitle</a> offers one way of adding captions, there are many more.</p>
        <p><em>The above content (including that below) is taken from the website <a

                    <p>The most popular social media channel has a lot to offer besides videos. However, if you decide
                        that your content strategy will include video, you should know that videos are muted by default
                        on some devices unless you click on them. In some cases, when your video is embedded on other
                        websites and pages, you need to manually click on the “volume” button in order to unmute them.
                    </p>
                    <p>That's why captions are so important, like in this <a
                            href="https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/posts/10157104753398781">example</a>, especially
                        when you promote your posts or choose to pay for ads.</p>
                    <p>Here's <a href="https://unmarketing.com/articles/the-vanity-of-going-viral-on-facebook">another
                            good example</a> that shows us the importance of captions on Facebook videos.</p>
                    <p>In this case, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnMarketing/videos/10155332058140942/">a video
                            posted by Scott Stratten</a> went viral and had over 1,300,000 10-second views with muted
                        sound. “Maybe they were looking at something else in their timeline, while the video played, or
                        they left to investigate that smell I referred to earlier, but the video is useless without
                        sound,” he said, referring to those 10-second plays.</p>
                    <p>What can we learn from this example?</p>
                    <p>We learn that a lot of people will see your auto-played Facebook videos for just a few seconds,
                        with muted sound. Thus, in order to catch their attention, you should use captions and text
                        transcriptions.</p>

                    <p>You can share videos with traditional Instagram posts, Instagram Stories, and Instagram Ads as
                        well. They all start muted on mobile devices and only play with volume once the viewer clicks on
                        them. It’s a great platform for storytelling but storytelling needs a story in order to be
                        effective. And a muted video does not communicate a story.</p>
                    <p>People who browse their timelines, just like on Facebook, don’t always click on all the posts
                        they browse through.</p>
                    <p>That's why it's important to gain maximum value from that couple of seconds your audience sees
                        your content before moving on to another post.</p>
                    <p>How? Well, just like before, you need subtitles.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there is no option for adding .srt subtitles on Instagram.</p>
                    <p>Instead, you’ll have to “burn” your subtitles directly on your video.</p>

                    <p>The good news is that, on LinkedIn, you can add subtitles in a similar way that you would for
                        YouTube and Facebook videos. Here’s an <a

                    <p>At the same time, you can use a hard subbed video as well, especially if you already created one
