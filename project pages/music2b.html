        <h4><strong>A few words about the video and subtitles</strong></h4>
        <p>The video goes straight to the song and therefore the lyrics appear immediately, there is no speaking
            involved.</p>

        <h4><strong>About the song, Strange Fruit</strong></h4>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.biography.com/news/billie-holiday-strange-fruit">Source: Eudie Pak, updated: Aug 25,
                    2020, Original: Apr 5, 2019</a></em></p>
        <p>In March 1939, a 23-year-old Billie Holiday walked up to the mic at West 4th's Cafe Society in New York City
            to sing her final song of the night. Per her request, the waiters stopped serving and the room went
            completely black, save for a spotlight on her face. And then she sang, softly in her raw and emotional
            voice: "Southern trees bear a strange fruit, Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, Black body swinging
            in the Southern breeze, Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees..."</p>
        <p>When Holiday finished, the spotlight turned off. When the lights came back on, the stage was empty. She was
            gone. And per her request, there was no encore. This was how Holiday performed "Strange Fruit," which she
            would determinedly sing for the next 20 years until her untimely death at the age of 44.</p>
        <p>"Strange Fruit" was originally a poem</p>
        <p>Holiday may have popularized "Strange Fruit" and turned it into a work of art, but it was a Jewish communist
            teacher and civil rights activist from the Bronx, Abel Meeropol, who wrote it, first as a poem, then later
            as a song.</p>
        <p>His inspiration? Meeropol came across a 1930 photo that captured the lynching of two Black men in Indiana.
            The visceral image haunted him for days and prompted him to put pen to paper.</p>
        <p>After he published "Strange Fruit" in a teachers union publication, Meeropol composed it into a song and
            passed it onto a nightclub owner, who then introduced it to Holiday.</p>
